# this file and set in the main Apache configuration file.


# The translated router pages use the MultiViews option to serve up a version of
# the web page depending on the client language preference.

# The Polish language web page translations will have a '.html.pl' extension for
# the MultiViews option so they must be allowed specifically and not blocked by
# the above prohibition on serving Perl scripts.  They must also be served with
# the HTML mime type.
